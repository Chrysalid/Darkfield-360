Required Features
-----------------
Update image gathering functions to update imageSet values and image tags

Tag group save methods
	- Save image information for processing
	- See the Taggroup_formatting.txt file for information
	
Put image acquisition in its own thread that can be stopped.

Bugs
---------
ImageProcessing processDarkFieldImages() uses camera size, not image sizes.
StartDPStoring / calibration does not update any current image sets yet

ImageSetName is being stored in image sets, but the variable is just SetName.
pixelToTilt function always gives a -ve/+ve tilt change? Y is certainly affected.
Storing ROI does not set ShiftX and ShiftY values, which would be useful.

Desired Features
----------------

Allow colour selection in createMap()
	- Make a generic colour selection dialog

Cycle through saved tilt settings

Save the central DP and highlight + label the target coordinates in an image set.


Currently
----------
Just seperated the tilt calculation part and the DP imaging parts.
	Need to make function to "finalize" the image set by taking DP images.
		This will be started with a button press in the DF360Dialog object
		Will need to update existing image set tag group with imageIDs and data.

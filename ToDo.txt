Required Features
-----------------
DisableModeWarnings implementation
Update moveToCurrentROI to something more useful and bind to a key

Update darkFieldImage to use ImageSet values for things ?

Make a function to produce persistent Image tags for integrated images

Tag group save methods
	- See the Taggroup_formatting.txt file for information
	
Put image acquisition in its own thread that can be stopped.

Make 'reticle' component objects identifiable so that cleaning the reticle from an image does not affect other components.
	~CreateDF360DialogClass also has this problem.


Bugs
---------
ImageProcessing processDarkFieldImages() uses camera size, not image sizes.
StartDPStoring / calibration does not update any current image sets yet
Either the StartingBFImage or FinalBFImage in DF imaging sequence does not have its filename saved because it always reads index 0.



Desired Features
----------------

Allow colour selection in createMap()
	- Make a generic colour selection dialog

Save the central DP and highlight + label the target coordinates in an image set.

'Get' the marker ring's d-spacing with a button on the new image config dialog.

Currently
----------
Make Auto-Save always on?
Progress bar + Seperate thread for imaging.

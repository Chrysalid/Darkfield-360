Persistant Tags for Toolkit
---------------------------
These tags are saved within the Gatan Digital Micrograph software for future use.
They can be seen in the Global Tags group and accessed with GetPersistentTagGroup();

ImageSetsTools
----------------
Each Image Set is stored as its own Taggroup and can be saved/loaded to/from files.
The accessible image sets are stored in the imageSets taggroup in the dataObject.
In the future these may be stored in the persistent tags, but this would raise issues with updates, reloading etc.

Image Tags
----------
These tags are stored with each image and image display.
Access them with ImageGetTagGroup()
